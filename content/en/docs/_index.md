This is the main documentation section for your Hugo Docsy site. Here you can organize all your documentation content using the directory structure approach.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Welcome to the Documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections to help you get started and make the most of your Hugo Docsy site.

### Getting Started

New to Hugo or Docsy? Start here to learn the basics and get your site up and running.

### User Guide

Detailed guides for using and customizing your site.

### Developer Guide

Technical documentation for developers who want to extend or customize the site.

## How This Documentation is Organized

This documentation uses Docsy's preferred directory structure approach:

- Each major section has its own directory under `content/en/docs/`
- Each directory contains an `_index.md` file that serves as the section landing page
- Individual pages are organized within these directories
- Navigation is automatically generated based on the directory structure and front matter weights

## Next Steps

1. **Create your first documentation section** by adding a new directory under `content/en/docs/`
2. **Add an `_index.md` file** to define the section
3. **Add individual pages** with proper front matter
4. **Use weights** to control the order of pages in the sidebar

Happy documenting!
